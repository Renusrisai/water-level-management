  - Monitors water level and quality in the tank using sensors.
  - Controls water inflow and outflow using actuators.
  - Sends automatic alerts for low water level, leaks, and abnormalities.
  - Provides real-time monitoring and historical data logging.

- **Smart Tap Control System:**
  - Enables automated control of water flow through smart taps.
  - User-friendly interface for setting water flow schedules and durations.
  - Remote control and monitoring of tap activities.

- **Web Application:**
  - Accessible through a web browser.
  - Displays real-time water level, quality, and system status.
  - Allows users to control the smart taps, view usage statistics, and configure system settings.
  - Provides data visualization and analytics for effective water management.

- **Mobile Application:**
  - Cross-platform mobile app (iOS and Android) for convenient access.
  - Offers similar features as the web application, optimized for mobile devices.
  - Push notifications for critical alerts and system updates.
